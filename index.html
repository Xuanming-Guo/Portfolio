                <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                <p>
                  I enjoy exploring new ideas, places and concepts and am always curious about how things work and eager to improve or even break them just to put them back together. A good challenge is always welcome, but there’s also a deep appreciation for simplicity when it’s done right. Outside of projects, I enjot spending time outoodrs, whether it’s a walk in the park to clear the head or hanging out with mates. Straightforward, well-designed, and purposeful things are always preferred.

                <h3>My Education</h3>
                <p>
                  Currently studying at Rochdale Sixth Form College
                  <br />
                  Achieved all 8s and 9s at GCSE
                  <br />
                  Currently predicted 4 A*s in Maths, Further Maths, Computer
                  Science, EPQ
                  <br />
                  Wish to go to university or degree apprenticeship in computer
                  science/AI/software engineering

                <h3>My Interests</h3>
                <p>
                  Academically, I like maths, problem solving and finding out
                  why something happens.
                  <br />
                  I also like programming and research into technological
                  advances.
                  <br />
                  Outside of academics, I enjoy going outside on walks, playing chess, going
                  for runs in the park, swimming or meeting with my mates.
                  <br />
                  I also like reading a lot. My top 3 books are Lord of the
                  Mysteries, Shadow Slave and Reverend Insanity.

                learn with it. In regards to other languages, I am not as experienced with them as I am with C#. I know Python enough to make an AI transformer model using Pytorch and I know a bit of HTML, CSS and JS as evident with this website.

                I am currently doing an EPQ and also writing up my Computer Science A level coursework. My EPQ is ~5000 words itself and my coursework is about 270 pages (50k words) on planning, designing, coding, testing and evaluating an evolution simulator using AI and ML. I feel like with these projects, I have learnt alot to do with academic writing and how to present concepts/designs in words.

                I believe I can organise, communicate and present projects efficiently. For organisation, I was/am able to make every single project deadline during high school and sixth form with time to spare and check, and this is on top of other dedications that also take time. I have also taken part in many team projects, and in which I always effectively communicate thoughts and ideas to the leaders (or listen to others if I was the leader) to ensure we all knew what we were doing. I have presented multiple projects to various people, such as the principal of my college and University of Cambridge students and even some professors there.
